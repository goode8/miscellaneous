# this is a quick cheatsheet for github. Still a work in progress
# i'm using the git bash app from windows (a command line) and github
#

#help
git verb --help 	#verbs: config,add
					#ignore file good idea

#start here
# open git bash. go to the folder you want to use. 
git init
#if repo exists on github...use the url
git remote add origin url 		# e.g. https://github.com/goode8/miscellaneous.git

#to get stuff down from the web.
#clone...get something from web copy to local
git clone https://github.com/goode8/miscellaneous.git . # dot for here
#part of setup?
git remote add origin https://github.com/goode8/miscellaneous.git

git add FILE_NAME!!!!!!!!!! #you have to do this a lot
##or 
git add -A 		#for all
git commit -m "adding blah blah"
git status		#informational

#feature branches
git branch bname 		#create branch
git branch 				#see all local branches and the one I'm working on
git checkout bname 		#change what youre working on
#do work on file, change the feature 
git branch -a 				#see all local branches and the one I'm working onwith details
	#AGAIN:
git status				#see my changes
git commit -m "adding comments "

#now push local to web
git push -u origin bname #u means local branch to remote branch with same name?

	# in 2020 github switched from master to main. So if you are looking at old docs and videos just replace with main. 

#make sure you're on the feature branch!!
#after changes
git diff
git status
git add fib.py
git commit -m "adding comments to beginning"
	#then
git pull origin bname 
git push origin bname
#or
git push -u origin bname  #u means local branch to remote branch with same name?

#now you should see it on github



#merge a branch to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch --merged 	#what's merged in so far
git merge bname
git push origin main

#deleting branch
git branch --merged 	#informational
git branch -d bname 	#deletes locally!!!
git branch -a 			#informational
git push origin --delete bname
						#deletes remote branch
